              <h4>A little History</h4>
                <p>In 1913 the street was named after General William Jenkins Worth.
                    This avenue was among the first areas developed in Palm Beach.
                     In 1918 architects Addison Mizner and Paris E. Singer introduced the
                      Mediterranean style to the region with their design for the Everglades Club 
                      at Worth Avenue's western end. Rising rents at the then-fashionable 
                    Beaux Arts Building on Lake Trail, north of the Biltmore Hotel, caused merchants to move
                    south to what became Worth Avenue. The area became known for its high-quality 
                    merchandise in the 1920s. Recognizing the value of the undeveloped street, 
                    the merchants formed the Worth Avenue Association in 1938. This organization 
                    maintains guidelines for the appearance, parking, etc. of the stores and the street.

                <h4>Worth Avenue sidewalk</h4>
                <p>
                Worth Avenue was lined with coconut palms that succumbed to lethal 
                yellowing blight in the 1970s. Adonidia or "Christmas palms" replaced 
                them, but they were not in proportion to the buildings on the street. 
                The street was renovated in 1983, but major makeover was completed in 2010.
                The $15.8 million Worth Avenue Improvement Project was conducted during 
                the off-season and lasted two years, with the Town of Palm Beach and 
                City of West Palm Beach responsible for $1.25 million of the cost 
                and $14.77 million from the issuance of public improvement revenue bonds.
                This major streetscape redesign included planting of 200 mature coconut palms, 
                each from 32 to 40 feet (10 to 12 m) tall, installing tabby concrete 
                sidewalks that are typically used for expensive residences, and building a 
                25-foot (8 m) clock tower on the beach side.

                Worth Avenue is an upscale shopping, art and dining district in Palm Beach, Florida. 
                  The Avenue stretches four blocks from Lake Worth to the Atlantic Ocean. 
                  Worth Avenue also includes smaller, architecturally significant "vias" 
                  off the main avenue. These pedestrian areas distinguish Worth Avenue from 
                  other shopping streets.<br /><br />
